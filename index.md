# Royal Enigmas

# Concept
We were asked to make a scene that corresponds with the Habib University context, so we thought what better than a scene that accurately depicts the ideal journey each student at Habib has to take. One of our team members made a 3d animation for his course earlier, so we recreated a scene from that animation. We used Maya to build our scene using planes and sphere, these objects were later triangulated for an easy import to our raytracer.

# Scene
We built the scene using Maya, the scene consists of triangulated meshes that make up the sphere, the stair case and even the walls in our scene

# Image Features
* The image contains multiple light sources to show yohsin colors at the end of the staircase.
* There are well over million primitives in the image.

# Code Features
In working on the extension of the simpler version of the RayTracer, which had more basic basic functionalities. Expandig the raytracer was a matter of adding more details to our scenes through Lights and Materials.

## Lights: 
We implemented the Ambient Light source, the Point Light source and the Spotlight source.

## Materials:
The materials we defined were Reflective and Matte.
